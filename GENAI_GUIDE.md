# 🤖 Using GenAI for Your Project - Best Practices

## What is GenAI Good For?

GenAI tools (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) can help you:

- ✅ Understand error messages
- ✅ Explain how code works
- ✅ Generate test cases
- ✅ Create documentation
- ✅ Suggest improvements
- ✅ Debug issues

## 📝 Simple Prompts for This Project

### When Starting Out

**Prompt 1: Understand the Project**

```
I'm working on a Python Flask REST API project called CodeCraftHub.
Can you explain what a REST API is and how Flask helps me build one?
Keep it simple - I'm a beginner.
```

**Prompt 2: Understand the Code**

```
Here's my app.py code: [paste code]

Can you explain:
1. What each main section does
2. How data flows through the application
3. What the @app.route decorators mean

Use simple language and examples.
```

### When You Get Errors

**Prompt Template:**

```
I'm running a Flask API and got this error:
[paste the complete error message]

I was trying to: [describe what you were doing]

What does this error mean and how do I fix it?
```

**Example:**

```
I'm running a Flask API and got this error:
"ImportError: No module named flask"

I was trying to: Start my app.py file

What does this error mean and how do I fix it?
```

### When Adding Features

**Prompt Template:**

```
I have a Flask API that stores courses in a JSON file.
I want to add a feature to: [describe feature]

Current code structure:
- app.py with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints
- Data stored in courses.json

How should I implement this? Keep it simple and show me the code.
```

**Example:**

```
I have a Flask API that stores courses in a JSON file.
I want to add a feature to: filter courses by status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)

Current code structure:
- app.py with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints
- Data stored in courses.json

How should I implement this? Show me the exact code to add.
```

### When Testing

**Prompt:**

```
I need to test my Flask API. I have these endpoints:
- POST /api/courses (add course)
- GET /api/courses (get all)
- PUT /api/courses/<id> (update)
- DELETE /api/courses/<id> (delete)

Give me:
1. Curl commands to test each endpoint
2. Example JSON data for testing
3. What successful responses should look like
```

### When Creating Documentation

**Prompt:**

```
I built a Flask API for tracking learning goals.

Create a user-friendly README that explains:
1. What the project does (2-3 sentences)
2. How to install it (step by step)
3. How to use each API endpoint (with examples)
4. Common troubleshooting tips

My target audience is: beginner Python developers
```

## 🎯 Best Practices for Using GenAI

### DO:

✅ **Be specific** - "How do I fix this syntax error on line 45?" is better than "my code doesn't work"
✅ **Provide context** - Share what you're trying to do and what you've already tried
✅ **Ask for explanations** - "Can you explain why this works?" helps you learn
✅ **Verify the response** - Always test the code GenAI gives you
✅ **Break problems down** - Ask about one thing at a time

### DON'T:

❌ **Copy without understanding** - Always read and understand the code
❌ **Trust blindly** - GenAI can make mistakes
❌ **Ask for complete solutions** - You learn more by building incrementally
❌ **Share sensitive data** - Don't paste passwords or personal information
❌ **Give up too quickly** - Try to solve it first, then ask GenAI

## 📚 Example Conversation Flow

**You:**

```
I'm trying to add a new course to my Flask API but getting a 400 error.
Here's my curl command:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/courses -d '{"name":"Python"}'

What's wrong?
```

**GenAI Response:**

```
The issue is that you're missing:
1. The Content-Type header
2. Required fields (description, target_date, status)

Try this instead:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/courses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Python Basics",
    "description": "Learn Python",
    "target_date": "2025-12-31",
    "status": "Not Started"
  }'
```

**You:**

```
That worked! Can you explain why the Content-Type header is needed?
```

**GenAI Response:**

```
The Content-Type header tells the server what format your data is in.
Flask needs "application/json" to know you're sending JSON data,
so it can parse it correctly with request.get_json().

Without it, Flask doesn't know how to interpret your data.
```

## 🔍 Debugging with GenAI

### Step-by-Step Debugging Process:

1. **Identify the error**
   - Copy the complete error message
   - Note what you were trying to do

2. **Ask GenAI**

   ```
   I got this error: [paste error]
   I was trying to: [describe action]
   What does it mean?
   ```

3. **Apply the fix**
   - Try the suggested solution
   - Test if it works

4. **If still broken**
   ```
   I tried your solution but now I'm getting: [new error]
   Here's my updated code: [paste relevant section]
   What should I do next?
   ```

## 💡 Advanced Prompts (For After You Finish)

### Improving Your Code

```
Review this Python Flask code and suggest improvements for:
1. Code organization
2. Error handling
3. Performance
4. Best practices

[paste your code]
```

### Adding Features

```
My Flask API tracks learning courses. I want to add:
- Email reminders for courses approaching target dates
- Progress percentage tracking
- Course categories

Which should I implement first and why?
Give me a roadmap for adding these features.
```

### Learning More

```
I successfully built a Flask REST API with file storage.
What are the next concepts I should learn to advance my skills?
Suggest a learning path with resources.
```

## 🎓 Remember

GenAI is a **tool to help you learn**, not a replacement for learning.

The best way to use it:

1. Try to solve problems yourself first
2. Use GenAI to understand concepts
3. Ask "why" and "how" questions
4. Test everything you implement
5. Learn from the explanations, not just the code

## ✅ Project Completion Checklist

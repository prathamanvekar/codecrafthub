# Instructor Guide - CodeCraftHub Project

## Overview of Changes

This is a **dramatically simplified** version of the original CodeCraftHub project, designed specifically for beginner students who found the original too complex.

### What Changed

#### REMOVED (Too Complex):

- ❌ MongoDB database and all database complexity
- ❌ JWT authentication and OAuth
- ❌ Microservices architecture
- ❌ Docker containers and deployment
- ❌ Multiple services (User, Course, Payment, etc.)
- ❌ Complex error handling patterns
- ❌ Production deployment concerns

#### ADDED (Beginner-Friendly):

- ✅ Simple text file storage (JSON)
- ✅ Single Python file application
- ✅ Clear, well-commented code
- ✅ Comprehensive README and guides
- ✅ Working test scripts
- ✅ Postman collection for easy testing
- ✅ GenAI usage guide
- ✅ Quick start guide

### Why These Changes?

**Original Project Issues:**

1. Required knowledge of databases, Docker, authentication
2. 6+ different services to understand
3. Complex deployment process
4. Too many moving parts for beginners
5. Students couldn't get it running easily

**New Project Benefits:**

1. Can run with just `python app.py`
2. Single file to understand (app.py)
3. Data visible in simple JSON file
4. Works immediately without setup
5. Clear learning progression

2. `GET /api/courses` - List all courses
3. `GET /api/courses/<id>` - Get specific course
4. `POST /api/courses` - Add new course
5. `PUT /api/courses/<id>` - Update course
6. `DELETE /api/courses/<id>` - Delete course

### Bonus Endpoints (Optional)

7. `GET /api/courses/stats` - Get statistics
8. `GET /api/courses/search?q=term` - Search courses

### 6. Bonus Features (5 points extra credit)

- **+3 pts** - Statistics endpoint implemented
- **+2 pts** - Search endpoint implemented
- **+2 pts** - Additional creative feature

## Expected Time Investment

- Setup and installation: 15 minutes
- Understanding the code: 30 minutes
- Testing all endpoints: 30 minutes
- Documentation/screenshots: 15 minutes

**Total: ~1.5 hours** (matches estimated time)

## Common Student Questions

### "Do I need to modify app.py?"

No! The provided code is complete and working. Students should:

1. Run it as-is
2. Test all endpoints
3. Understand how it works
4. (Optional) Add bonus features

### "What if I want to change something?"

Encourage them to:

1. Get it working first
2. Then experiment with changes
3. Use GenAI to help with modifications

### "How do I prove I tested it?"

Students should submit:

1. Screenshot of successful API calls
2. Their courses.json file with data
3. (Optional) Video of testing

## Troubleshooting for Students

### Issue: "Module not found: flask"

**Solution:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Issue: "Port already in use"

**Solution:** Change port in app.py or stop other applications

### Issue: "Permission denied on test_api.sh"

**Solution:** `chmod +x test_api.sh` or run with bash

### Issue: "JSON decode error"

**Solution:** Delete courses.json, it will be recreated

## Extensions for Advanced Students

If students finish early, suggest:

1. **Add filtering**: Filter by status, date range
2. **Add sorting**: Sort by date, name, status
3. **Add categories**: Categorize courses (Programming, Design, etc.)
4. **Add progress tracking**: Percentage complete for each course
5. **Add validation**: Better date validation, duplicate detection
6. **Add export**: Export to CSV or PDF
7. **Create frontend**: Simple HTML interface

## Assessment Tips

### Quick Validation (5 minutes)

1. Check if app.py runs
2. Test POST endpoint - add a course
3. Test GET endpoint - view courses
4. Check courses.json file exists

### Thorough Review (15 minutes)

1. Run their test_api.sh script
2. Import their Postman collection
3. Verify all endpoints
4. Check error handling
5. Review their documentation

### What Makes an "A" Project

- All endpoints work flawlessly
- Error handling is comprehensive
- Data persists correctly
- Well-documented
